# Next Word Predictor

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word in a given sequence. The model is trained on a dataset of short jokes and leverages LSTM to understand the sequential context of the text, enabling accurate next-word predictions.

## Current Status
- **Still Improving**: Work is ongoing to optimize the model for better performance and accuracy.

## Features
- Predicts the next word in a given sequence of text using LSTM.
- Trained on a dataset of short jokes for accurate word prediction.
- Continuously improving with future optimizations planned for accuracy.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas kagglehub
