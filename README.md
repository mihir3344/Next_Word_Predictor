# Next Word Predictor

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the next word in a given sequence. The model is trained on a dataset of short jokes and can accurately predict the next word based on the given input text. While the model is ready, ongoing improvements are being made to enhance its performance and accuracy.

## Current Status
- **Model Ready**: The next word predictor model is fully trained and functional.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous work is being done to improve the model's performance and accuracy.

## Features
- Predicts the next word in a sequence using LSTM.
- Trained on a dataset of short jokes for accurate predictions.
- Ongoing improvements for better performance and fine-tuning.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas kagglehub
